Sadness is an emotion that has a bad reputation in our society and is often categorized as weakness or depression. In the film, Inside Out, it shows its viewers what is happening in the mind of an 11-year-old girl, Riley. At the beginning of the film, Joy admits that she doesn’t understand what Sadness is for or why it’s even in Riley’s head when sadness is introduced. At one point in life, many of us have probably questioned the purpose of sadness and why we need it because it makes us feel terrible tricking us into thinking we might be depressed. Sadness is literally the very definition and being of sorrow and gloom. She is hardly ever used because Joy is the boss and doesn 't want Riley to ever be sad, even when Riley needs to be. Because of this, Joy treats Sadness very unfairly. Secretly, however, Sadness yearns to earn her place among the other emotions, even though the others do not believe Sadness has a purpose in the mind and almost always prevent her from trying. She is the most sensitive out of all the emotions, as she felt genuinely hurt by Joy 's abandonment because Riley needs to be happy, which made poor Sadness feel she was truly useless and unneeded
